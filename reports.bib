  institution	= {{arXiv}},
  abstract	= {Since the first publication of the "OWASP Top 10" (2004),
		  cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have always been
		  among the top 5 web application security bugs. Black-box
		  vulnerability scanners are widely used in the industry to
		  reproduce (XSS) attacks automatically. In spite of the
		  technical sophistication and advancement, previous work
		  showed that black-box scanners miss a non-negligible
		  portion of vulnerabilities, and report non-existing,
		  non-exploitable or uninteresting vulnerabilities.
		  Unfortunately, these results hold true even for XSS
		  vulnerabilities, which are relatively simple to trigger if
		  compared, for instance, to logic flaws. Black-box scanners
		  have not been studied in depth on this vertical: knowing
		  precisely how scanners try to detect XSS can provide useful
		  insights to understand their limitations, to design better
		  detection methods. In this paper, we present and discuss
		  the results of a detailed and systematic study on 6
		  black-box web scanners (both proprietary and open source)
		  that we conducted in coordination with the respective
		  vendors. To this end, we developed an automated tool to (1)
		  extract the payloads used by each scanner, (2) distill the
		  "templates" that have originated each payload, (3) evaluate
		  them according to quality indicators, and (4) perform a
		  cross-scanner analysis. Unlike previous work, our testbed
		  application, which contains a large set of XSS
		  vulnerabilities, including DOM XSS, was gradually
		  retrofitted to accomodate for the payloads that triggered
		  no vulnerabilities. Our analysis reveals a highly
		  fragmented scenario. Scanners exhibit a wide variety of
		  distinct payloads, a non-uniform approach to fuzzing and
		  mutating the payloads, and a very diverse detection
		  effectiveness.},

  abstract	= {Popularity and complexity of malicious mobile applications
		  are rising, making their analysis difficult and labor
		  intensive. Mobile application analysis is indeed inherently
		  different from desktop application analysis: In the latter,
		  the interaction of the user (i.e., victim) is crucial for
		  the malware to correctly expose all its malicious
		  behaviors. We propose a novel approach to analyze
		  (malicious) mobile applications. The goal is to exercise
		  the user interface (UI) of an Android application to
		  effectively trigger malicious behaviors, automatically. Our
		  key intuition is to record and reproduce the UI
		  interactions of a potential victim of the malware, so as to
		  stimulate the relevant behaviors during dynamic analysis.
		  To make our approach scale, we automatically re-execute the
		  recorded UI interactions on apps that are similar to the
		  original ones. These characteristics make our system
		  orthogonal and complementary to current dynamic analysis
		  and UI-exercising approaches. We developed our approach and
		  experimentally shown that our stimulation allows to reach a
		  higher code coverage than automatic UI exercisers, so to
		  unveil interesting malicious behaviors that are not exposed
		  when using other approaches. Our approach is also suitable
		  for crowdsourcing scenarios, which would push further the
		  collection of new stimulation traces. This can potentially
		  change the way we conduct dynamic analysis of (mobile)
		  applications, from fully automatic only, to user-centric

  institution	= {{arXiv}},
  abstract	= {Modern botnets rely on domain-generation algorithms (DGAs)
		  to build resilient command-and-control infrastructures.
		  Recent works focus on recognizing automatically generated
		  domains (AGDs) from DNS traffic, which potentially allows
		  to identify previously unknown AGDs to hinder or disrupt
		  botnets' communication capabilities. The state-of-the-art
		  approaches require to deploy low-level DNS sensors to
		  access data whose collection poses practical and privacy
		  issues, making their adoption problematic. We propose a
		  mechanism that overcomes the above limitations by analyzing
		  DNS traffic data through a combination of linguistic and
		  IP-based features of suspicious domains. In this way, we
		  are able to identify AGD names, characterize their DGAs and
		  isolate logical groups of domains that represent the
		  respective botnets. Moreover, our system enriches these
		  groups with new, previously unknown AGD names, and produce
		  novel knowledge about the evolving behavior of each tracked
		  botnet. We used our system in real-world settings, to help
		  researchers that requested intelligence on suspicious
		  domains and were able to label them as belonging to the
		  correct botnet automatically. Additionally, we ran an
		  evaluation on 1,153,516 domains, including AGDs from both
		  modern (e.g., Bamital) and traditional (e.g., Conficker,
		  Torpig) botnets. Our approach correctly isolated families
		  of AGDs that belonged to distinct DGAs, and set
		  automatically generated from non-automatically generated
		  domains apart in 94.8 percent of the cases.},

  abstract	= {Modern vehicles, and in particular electric vehicles, are
		  increasingly being equipped with interconnected computer
		  systems, which collect information through vehicular
		  sources and remote, Internet-connected services.
		  Unfortunately, this creates a non-negligible attack
		  surface, which extends even more when vehicles are

		  fact, embedded systems on vehicles have been developed to
		  address safety, not security requirements. Furthermore,
		  vehicles have real-time constraints, and the typical
		  embedded architectures used on board significantly
		  complicate security designs. In this paper, we introduce a
		  communication framework that addresses these challenges and
		  we demonstrate how a smartphone can interact with a vehicle
		  in a secure and safe manner. To this end, we design a
		  security session layer that ensures end-to-end security
		  transparently. We conduct an experimental evaluation on a

		  our solution is practical and easy to use, satisfies

		  by taking into account the limited capabilities of our
		  target architecture. More precisely, we implement our

  abstract	= {The world of information and communication technology is
		  experiencing changes that, regardless of some skepticism,
		  are bringing to life the concept of ``utility computing''.
		  The nostalgics observed a parallel between the emerging
		  paradigm of cloud computing and the traditional

		  reincarnation of mainframes available on a pay-per-use
		  basis, and equipped with virtual, elastic, paid
		  disks-as-a-service that replace the old physical disks with
		  quotas. This comparison is fascinating, but more
		  importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground for
		  constructive critiques regarding the security of such
		  computing paradigm. In this paper we explore similar
		  analogies to discuss our position about the current
		  countermeasures (e.g., intrusion detection systems,
		  anti-viruses), developed to mitigate well-known security
		  threats. By reasoning on said affinities, we focus on the
		  simple case of anomaly-based approaches, which are employed
		  in many modern protection tools, not just in intrusion
		  detectors. We illustrate our position by the means of a
		  simple running example and show that attacks against

  abstract	= {Spying on a person is a subtle, yet easy and reliable
		  method to obtain sensitive information. Even if the victim
		  is well protected from digital attacks, spying may be a
		  viable option. In addition, the pervasiveness of mobile
		  devices increases an attacker's opportunities to observe
		  the victims while they are accessing or entering sensitive
		  information. This risk is exacerbated by the remarkable
		  user-friendliness of modern, mobile graphical interfaces,
		  which, for example, display visual feedback to improve the
		  user experience and make common tasks,
		  \$\ensuremath{\backslash}backslash\$eg, typing, more
		  natural. Unfortunately, this turns into the well-known
		  trade-off between usability and security. In this work, we
		  focus on how usability of modern mobile interfaces may

		  practical eavesdropping attack, able to recognize the
		  sequence of keystrokes from a low-resolution video,
		  recorded while the victim is typing on a touchscreen. Our
		  attack exploits the fact that modern virtual keyboards, as
		  opposed to mechanical ones, often display magnified,

		  recognition. On real-world settings, our attack can
		  automatically recognize up to 97.07\% (91.03\% on average)
		  of the keystrokes, with a 1.15\% error rate and a speed
