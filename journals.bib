  abstract      = {In modern factories, ``controlled'' manufacturing systems,
                  such as industrial robots, CNC machines, or 3D printers, are
                  often connected in a control network, together with a
                  plethora of heterogeneous control devices. Despite the
                  obvious advantages in terms of production and ease of
                  maintenance, this trend raises non-trivial cybersecurity
                  concerns. Often, the devices employed are not designed for an
                  interconnected world, but cannot be promptly replaced: In
                  fact, they have essentially become legacy systems, embodying
                  design patterns where components and networks are accounted
                  as trusted elements. In this paper, we take a holistic view
                  of the security issues (and challenges) that arise in
                  designing and securely deploying controlled manufacturing
                  systems, using industrial robots as a case study---indeed,
                  robots are the most representative instance of a complex
                  automatically controlled industrial device. Following up to
                  our previous experimental analysis, we take a broad look at
                  the deployment of industrial robots in a typical factory
                  network and at the security challenges that arise from the
                  interaction between operators and machines; then, we propose
                  actionable points to secure industrial cyber-physical
                  systems, and we discuss the limitations of the current
                  standards in industrial robotics to account for active
                  attackers.},

                  program protection techniques to circumvent anti-viruses, or
                  simply hinder reverse engineering. In response to the
                  diffusion of anti-virus applications, several researches have
                  proposed a plethora of analyses and approaches to highlight
                  their limitations when malware authors employ
                  program-protection techniques. An important contribution of
                  this work is a systematization of the state of the art of
                  anti-virus apps, comparing the existing approaches and
                  providing a detailed analysis of their pros and cons. As a
                  result of our systematization, we notice the lack of openness

                  test the resilience of their products against a large dataset
                  of malware samples and obfuscations, and to obtain insights

                  fraud analysis and investigation},
  journaltitle  = {Computers \& Security},
  abstract      = {The significant growth of online banking frauds, fueled by
                  the underground economy of malware, raised the need for
                  effective fraud analysis systems. Unfortunately, almost all
                  of the existing approaches adopt black box models and
                  mechanisms that do not give any justifications to analysts.
                  Also, the development of such methods is stifled by limited
                  Internet banking data availability for the scientific
                  community. In this paper we describe BankSealer, a decision
                  support system for online banking fraud analysis and
                  investigation. During a training phase, BankSealer builds
                  easy-to-understand models for each customer's spending
                  habits, based on past transactions. First, it quantifies the
                  anomaly of each transaction with respect to the customer
                  historical profile. Second, it finds global clusters of
                  customers with similar spending habits. Third, it uses a
                  temporal threshold system that measures the anomaly of the
                  current spending pattern of each customer, with respect to
                  his or her past spending behavior. With this threefold
                  profiling approach, it mitigates the under-training due to
                  the lack of historical data for building well-trained
                  profiles, and the evolution of users' spending habits over
                  time. At runtime, BankSealer supports analysts by ranking new
                  transactions that deviate from the learned profiles, with an
                  output that has an easily understandable, immediate
                  statistical meaning.
                  
                  Our evaluation on real data, based on fraud scenarios built
                  in collaboration with domain experts that replicate typical,
                  real-world attacks (e.g., credential stealing, banking trojan
                  activity, and frauds repeated over time), shows that our
                  approach correctly ranks complex frauds. In particular, we
                  measure the effectiveness, the computational resource
                  requirements and the capabilities of BankSealer to mitigate
                  the problem of users that performed a low number of
                  transactions. Our system ranks frauds and anomalies with up
                  to 98\% detection rate and with a maximum daily computation
                  time of 4~min. Given the good results, a leading Italian bank
                  deployed a version of BankSealer in their environment to
                  analyze frauds.},

                  users and the surrounding environment. An indirect measure of
                  this trend is the increasing amount of security threats
                  against mobile devices, which in turn created a demand for
                  protection tools. Protection tools, unfortunately, add an
                  additional burden for the smartphone's battery power, which
                  is a precious resource. This observation motivates the need
                  for smarter (security) applications, designed and capable of
                  running within adaptive energy goals. Although this problem
                  affects other areas, in the security area this research
                  direction is referred to as "green security". In general, a
                  fundamental need to the researches toward creating
                  energy-aware applications, consist in having appropriate
                  power models that capture the full dynamic of devices and
                  users. This is not an easy task because of the highly dynamic
                  environment and usage habits. In practice, this goal requires
                  easy mechanisms to measure the power consumption and
                  approaches to create accurate models. The existing approaches
                  that tackle this problem are either not accurate or not
                  applicable in practice due to their limiting requirements. We
                  propose MPower, a power-sensing platform and adaptive power
                  modeling platform for Android mobile devices. The MPower
                  approach creates an adequate and precise knowledge base of
                  the power "behavior" of several different devices and users,
                  which allows us to create better device-centric power models
                  that considers the main hardware components and how they
                  contributed to the overall power consumption. In this paper
                  we consolidate our perspective work on MPower by providing
                  the implementation details and evaluation on 278 users and
                  about 22.5 million power-related data. Also, we explain how
                  MPower is useful in those scenarios where low-power,
                  unobtrusive, accurate power modeling is necessary (e.g.,
                  green security applications).},
