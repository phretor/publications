  abstract      = {Ransomware is a class of malware that aim at preventing
                  victims from accessing valuable data, typically via data
                  encryption or device locking, and ask for a payment to
                  release the target. In the past year, instances of ransomware
                  attacks have been spotted on mobile devices too. However,
                  despite their relatively low infection rate, we notice that
                  the techniques used by mobile ransomware are quite
                  sophisticated, and different from those used by ransomware
                  against traditional computers.
                  
                  Through an in-depth analysis of about 100 samples of
                  currently active ransomware apps, we conclude that most of
                  them pass undetected by state-of-the-art tools, which are
                  unable to recognize the abuse of benign features for
                  malicious purposes. The main reason is that such tools rely
                  on an inadequate and incomplete set of features. The most
                  notable examples are the abuse of reflection and
                  device-administration APIs, appearing in modern ransomware to
                  evade analysis and detection, and to elevate their privileges
                  (e.g., to lock or wipe the device). Moreover, current
                  solutions introduce several false positives in the na ̈ıve
                  way they detect cryptographic-APIs abuse, flagging goodware
                  apps as ransomware merely because they rely on cryptographic
                  libraries. Last but not least, the performance overhead of
                  current approaches is unacceptable for appstore-scale
                  workloads.
                  
                  In this work, we tackle the aforementioned limitations and
                  propose GreatEatlon, a next-generation mobile ransomware
                  detector. We foresee GreatEatlon deployed on the appstore
                  side, as a preventive countermeasure. At its core,
                  GreatEatlon uses static program-analysis techniques to
                  ``resolve'' reflection-based, anti-analysis attempts, to
                  recognize abuses of the device administration API, and
                  extract accurate data-flow information required to detect
                  truly malicious uses of cryptographic APIs. Given the
                  significant resources utilized by Great- Eatlon, we prepend
                  to its core a fast pre-filter that quickly discards obvious
                  goodware, in order to avoid wasting computer cycles.
                  
                  We tested GreatEatlon on thousands of samples of goodware,
                  generic malware and ransomware applications, and showed that
                  it surpasses current approaches both in speed and detection
                  capabilities, while keeping the false negative rate below
                  1.3\%. },

  abstract      = {Several tools for program tracing and introspection exist.
                  These tools can be used to analyze potentially malicious or
                  untrusted programs. In this setting, it is important to
                  prevent that the target program determines whether it is
                  being traced or not. This is typically achieved by minimizing
                  the code of the introspection routines and any artifact or
                  side-effect that the program can leverage. Indeed, the most
                  recent approaches consist of lightly instrumented operating
                  systems or thin hypervisors running directly on bare metal.
                  
                  Following this research trend, we investigate the feasibility
                  of transparently tracing a Linux/ARM program without
                  modifying the software stack, while keeping the analysis cost
                  and flexibility compatible with state of the art emulation-
                  or bare-metal-based approaches. As for the typical program
                  tracing task, our goal is to reconstruct the stream of system
                  call invocations along with the respective un-marshalled
                  arguments.
                  
                  We propose to leverage the availability of on-chip debugging
                  interfaces of modern ARM systems, which are accessible via
                  JTAG. More precisely, we developed OpenST, an open-source
                  prototype tracer that allowed us to analyze the performance
                  overhead and to assess the transparency with respect to
                  evasive, real-world malicious programs. OpenST has two
                  tracing modes: In-kernel dynamic tracing and external
                  tracing. The in-kernel dynamic tracing mode uses the JTAG
                  interface to ``hot-patch'' the system calls at runtime,
                  injecting introspection code. This mode is more transparent
                  than emulator based approaches, but assumes that the traced
                  program does not have access to the kernel memory where the
                  introspection code is loaded. The external tracing mode
                  removes this assumption by using the JTAG interface to manage
                  hardware breakpoints.
                  
                  Our tests show that OpenST's greater transparency comes at
                  the price of a steep performance penalty. However, with a
                  cost model, we show that OpenST scales better than the state
                  of the art, bare-metal-based approach, while remaining
                  equally stealthy to evasive malware.},

                  their limitations when malware authors employ

                  anti-virus apps, comparing the existing approaches and

                  permission systems as found in modern mobile operating
                  systems. However, comparatively little assistance is
                  available for defining and enforcing access control policies
                  within multiuser applications. These applications, often
                  found in enterprise environments, allow multiple users to
                  operate at different privilege levels in terms of exercising
                  application functionality and accessing data. Developers of
                  such applications bear a heavy burden in ensuring that
                  security policies over code and data in this setting are

                  allow programmers to partially annotate code and data with
                  simple privilege level tags, and uses a static analysis to
                  infer suitable tags for the entire application. At runtime,
                  policies are extracted from the resulting binaries and are
                  enforced by a modified operating system kernel. Our

                  malicious apps. Motivated by the high threat level posed by

                  analysis and intelligence tools, we automated the extraction
                  of such artifacts and created a malware tracker named
                  DroydSeuss. DroydSeuss first processes applications both
                  statically and dynamically, extracting relevant strings that
                  contain traces of communication endpoints. Second, it
                  prioritizes the extracted strings based on the APIs that
                  manipulate them. Finally, DroydSeuss correlates the endpoints
                  with descriptive metadata from the samples, providing
                  aggregated statistics, raw data, and cross-sample information
                  that allow researchers to pinpoint relevant groups of
                  applications. We connected DroydSeuss to the VirusTotal daily

                  activity. We manually analyzed its output and found

                  the most frequent itemset unveiled a campaign currently

                  performance. In spite of its wide adoption by developers,
                  implementing DCL in a secure way is challenging, leading to
                  serious vulnerabilities such as remote code injection.
                  Previous academic and community attempts at solving this
                  problem are unfortunately either impractical or incomplete,
                  or in some cases exhibit vulnerabilities. In this paper, we
                  propose, design, implement and test Grab 'n Run, a novel code
                  verification protocol and a series of supporting libraries,
                  APIs, and components, that address the problem by abstracting
                  away from the developer challenging implementation details.
                  Grab 'n Run is designed to be practical: among its tools, it
                  provides a drop-in library, which requires no modifications
                  to the Android framework or the underlying Dalvik/ART
                  runtime, is very similar to the native API, and most code can
                  be automatically rewritten to use it. Grab 'n Run also
                  contains an application rewriting tool, which allows easy
                  porting of existing applications to use the secure API of its
                  library. We evaluate Grab 'n Run library with a user study,
                  obtaining impressive results in vulnerability reduction, ease
                  of use and speed of development. We also show that the
                  performance overhead introduced by our library is negligible.
                  The library is released as free software.},

                  Our approach is based on detecting the ``build- ing blocks''
                  that are typically needed to implement a mobile ransomware
                  application. Specifically, HelDroid detects, in a generic
                  way, if an app is attempting to lock or encrypt the device
                  without the user’s consent, and if ransom requests are
                  displayed on the screen. Our technique works without
                  requiring that a sample of a certain family is available
                  beforehand. We implemented HelDroid and tested it on
                  real-world Android ransomware samples. On a large dataset
                  comprising hundreds of thousands of APKs including goodware,
                  malware, scareware, and ransomware, HelDroid exhibited nearly
                  zero false positives and the capability of recognizing
                  unknown ransomware samples. },

  abstract      = {The capabilities of modern devices, coupled with the almost
                  ubiquitous availability of Internet connectivity, have
                  resulted in photos being shared online at an unprecedented
                  scale. This is further amplified by the popularity of social
                  networks and the immediacy they offer in content sharing.
                  Existing access control mechanisms are too coarse-grained to
                  handle cases of conflicting interests between the users
                  associated with a photo; stories of embarrassing or
                  inappropriate photos being widely accessible have become
                  quite common. In this paper, we propose to rethink access
                  control when applied to photos, in a way that allows us to
                  effectively prevent unwanted individuals from recognizing
                  users in a photo. The core concept behind our approach is to
                  change the granularity of access control from the level of
                  the photo to that of a user's personally identifiable
                  information (PII). In this work, we consider the face as the
                  PII. When another user attempts to access a photo, the system
                  determines which faces the user does not have the permission
                  to view, and presents the photo with the restricted faces
                  blurred out. Our system takes advantage of the existing face
                  recognition functionality of social networks, and can
                  interoperate with the current photo-level access control
                  mechanisms. We implement a proof-of-concept application for
                  Facebook, and demonstrate that the performance overhead of
                  our approach is minimal. We also conduct a user study to
                  evaluate the privacy offered by our approach, and find that
                  it effectively prevents users from identifying their contacts
                  in 87.35\% of the restricted photos. Finally, our study
                  reveals the misconceptions about the privacy offered by
                  existing mechanisms, and demonstrates that users are positive
                  towards the adoption of an intuitive, straightforward access
                  control mechanism that allows them to manage the visibility
                  of their face in published photos.},

                  usually rely on ad-hoc collections of interesting dynamic
                  patterns known as behaviors in the malware-analysis community
                  and static patterns known as signatures in the antivirus
                  community. Such patterns are often part of the skill set of
                  the analyst, sometimes implemented in manually-created
                  post-processing scripts. It would be desirable to be able to
                  automatically find such behaviors, present them to analysts,
                  and create a systematic catalog of matching rules and
                  relevant implementations. We propose Jackdaw, a system that
                  finds interesting dynamic patterns, and ranks them to unveil
                  potentially interesting behaviors. Then, it annotates them
                  with static information, capturing the distinct
                  implementations of each across different malware families.
                  Finally, Jackdaw associates semantic information to the
                  behaviors, so as to create a descriptive summary that helps
                  the analysts in querying the catalog of behaviors by type. To
                  do this, it leverages the dynamic information and an indexed
                  Web-based knowledge databases. We implement and demonstrate
                  Jackdaw on the Win32 API (even if the technique can be
                  generalized to any OS). On a dataset of 2,136 distinct
                  binaries, including both malicious and benign libraries and
                  executables, we compared the behaviors extracted
                  automatically against a ground truth of 44 behaviors created
                  manually by expert analysts. Jackdaw found 77.3\% of them and
                  was able to exclude spurious behaviors in 99.6\% cases. We
                  also discovered 466 novel behaviors, among which manual
                  exploration and review by expert reverse engineers revealed
                  interesting findings and confirmed the correctness of the
                  semantic tagging.},

  abstract      = {The significant growth of online banking frauds, fueled by
                  the underground economy of malware, raised the need for
                  effective fraud analysis systems. Unfortunately, almost all
                  of the existing approaches adopt black box models and
                  mechanisms that do not give any justifications to analysts.
                  Also, the development of such methods is stifled by limited
                  Internet banking data availability for the scientific
                  community. In this paper we describe BankSealer, a decision
                  support system for online banking fraud analysis and
                  investigation. During a training phase, BankSealer builds
                  easy-to-understand models for each customer's spending
                  habits, based on past transactions. First, it quantifies the
                  anomaly of each transaction with respect to the customer
                  historical profile. Second, it finds global clusters of
                  customers with similar spending habits. Third, it uses a
                  temporal threshold system that measures the anomaly of the
                  current spending pattern of each customer, with respect to
                  his or her past spending behavior. With this threefold
                  profiling approach, it mitigates the under-training due to
                  the lack of historical data for building well-trained
                  profiles, and the evolution of users' spending habits over
                  time. At runtime, BankSealer supports analysts by ranking new
                  transactions that deviate from the learned profiles, with an
                  output that has an easily understandable, immediate
                  statistical meaning.
                  
                  Our evaluation on real data, based on fraud scenarios built
                  in collaboration with domain experts that replicate typical,
                  real-world attacks (e.g., credential stealing, banking trojan
                  activity, and frauds repeated over time), shows that our
                  approach correctly ranks complex frauds. In particular, we
                  measure the effectiveness, the computational resource
                  requirements and the capabilities of BankSealer to mitigate
                  the problem of users that performed a low number of
                  transactions. Our system ranks frauds and anomalies with up
                  to 98\% detection rate and with a maximum daily computation
                  time of 4~min. Given the good results, a leading Italian bank
                  deployed a version of BankSealer in their environment to
                  analyze frauds.},

                  accounts, Facebook launched a form of two-factor
                  authentication called social authentication (SA), where users
                  are required to identify photos of their friends to complete
                  a log-in attempt. Recent research, however, demonstrated that
                  attackers can bypass the mechanism by employing face
                  recognition software. Here we demonstrate an alternative
                  attack. that employs image comparison techniques to identify
                  the SA photos within an offline collection of the users'
                  photos. In this paper, we revisit the concept of SA and
                  design a system with a novel photo selection and
                  transformation process, which generates challenges that are
                  robust against these attacks. The intuition behind our photo
                  selection is to use photos. that fail software-based face
                  recognition, while remaining recognizable to humans who are
                  familiar with the depicted people. The photo transformation
                  process. creates challenges in the form of photo collages,
                  where faces are transformed so as to render image matching
                  techniques ineffective. We experimentally confirm the
                  robustness of our approach against three template. matching
                  algorithms that solve 0.4 percent of the challenges, while
                  requiring four orders of magnitude more processing effort.
                  Furthermore, when the transformations are applied, face
                  detection software fails to detect even a single face. Our
                  user studies confirm that users are able to identify their
                  friends in over 99\% of the photos with faces unrecognizable
                  by software, and can solve over 94 percent of the challenges
                  with transformed photos.},

  abstract      = {Since the first publication of the "OWASP Top 10" (2004),
                  cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have always been
                  among the top 5 web application security bugs. Black-box
                  vulnerability scanners are widely used in the industry to
                  reproduce (XSS) attacks automatically. In spite of the
                  technical sophistication and advancement, previous work
                  showed that black-box scanners miss a non-negligible portion
                  of vulnerabilities, and report non-existing, non-exploitable
                  or uninteresting vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, these
                  results hold true even for XSS vulnerabilities, which are
                  relatively simple to trigger if compared, for instance, to
                  logic flaws. Black-box scanners have not been studied in
                  depth on this vertical: knowing precisely how scanners try to
                  detect XSS can provide useful insights to understand their
                  limitations, to design better detection methods. In this
                  paper, we present and discuss the results of a detailed and
                  systematic study on 6 black-box web scanners (both
                  proprietary and open source) that we conducted in
                  coordination with the respective vendors. To this end, we
                  developed an automated tool to (1) extract the payloads used
                  by each scanner, (2) distill the "templates" that have
                  originated each payload, (3) evaluate them according to
                  quality indicators, and (4) perform a cross-scanner analysis.
                  Unlike previous work, our testbed application, which contains
                  a large set of XSS vulnerabilities, including DOM XSS, was
                  gradually retrofitted to accomodate for the payloads that
                  triggered no vulnerabilities. Our analysis reveals a highly
                  fragmented scenario. Scanners exhibit a wide variety of
                  distinct payloads, a non-uniform approach to fuzzing and
                  mutating the payloads, and a very diverse detection

                  computers and communication protocols, which are often
                  affected by security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we first
                  analyze the attack surface of a real building automation
                  system - based on the widely used KNX protocol-connected to a
                  general-purpose IP network. To this end, we analyze the
                  vulnerabilities of KNX-based networks highlighted by previous
                  research work, which, however, did not corroborate their
                  findings with experimental results. To verify the practical
                  exploitability of these vulnerabilities and their potential
                  impact, we implement a full-fledged testbed infrastructure
                  that reproduces the typical deployment of a building
                  automation system. On this testbed, we show the feasibility
                  of a practical attack that leverages and combines the
                  aforementioned vulnerabilities. We show the ease of reverse
                  engineering the vendor-specific components of the KNX
                  protocol. Our attack leverages the IP-to-KNX connectivity to
                  send arbitrary commands which are executed by the actuators.
                  We conclude that the vulnerabilities highlighted by previous
                  work are effectively exploitable in practice, with severe
                  results. Although we use KNX as a target, our work can be
                  generalized to other communication protocols, often
                  characterized by similar issues. Finally, we analyze the
                  countermeasures proposed in previous literature and reveal
                  the limitations that prevent their adoption in practice. We
                  suggest a practical stopgap measure to protect real KNX-based
                  BASs from our attack.},

                  security and privacy problems in a real-world, large- scale
                  social network (i.e., Facebook), and summarize our
                  conclusions in a series of "lessons learned". We first
                  conclude that it is better to adequately describe the
                  potential ethical concerns from the very beginning and plan
                  ahead the institutional review board (IRB) request. Even
                  though sometimes optional, the IRB approval is a valuable
                  point from the reviewer's perspective. Another aspect that
                  needs planning is getting in touch with the online social
                  network security team, which takes a substantial amount of
                  time. With their support, "bending the rules" (e.g., using
                  scrapers) when the experimental goals require so, is easier.
                  Clearly, in cases where critical technical vulnerabilities
                  are found during the research, the general recommendations
                  for responsible disclosure should be followed. Gaining the
                  audience's engagement and trust was essential to the success
                  of our user study. Participants felt more comfortable when
                  subscribing to our experiments, and also responsibly reported
                  bugs and glitches. We did not observe the same behavior in
                  crowd-sourcing workers, who were instead more interested in
                  obtaining their rewards. On a related point, our experience
                  suggests that crowd sourcing should not be used alone:
                  Setting up tasks is more time consuming than it seems, and
                  researchers must insert some sentinel checks to ensure that
                  workers are not submitting random answers.From a logistics
                  point of view, we learned that having at least a high-level
                  plan of the experiments pays back, especially when the IRB
                  requires a detailed description of the work and the data to
                  be collected. However, over planning can be dangerous because
                  the measurement goals can change dynamically. From a
                  technical point of view, partially connected to the logistics
                  remarks, having a complex and large data-gathering and
                  analysis framework may be counterproductive in terms of
                  set-up a- d management overhead. From our experience we
                  suggest to choose simple technologies that scale up if needed
                  but, more importantly, can scale down. For example, launching
                  a quick query should be straightforward, and the frameworks
                  should not impose too much overhead for formulating it. We
                  conclude with a series of practical recommendations on how to
                  successfully collect data from online social networks (e.g.,
                  using techniques for network multipresence, mimicking user
                  behavior, and other crawling "tricks"') and avoid abusing the
                  online service, while gathering the data required by the
                  experiments.},

                  applications are delivered through software repositories,
                  commonly known as application markets. Other mobile
                  platforms, such as Apple iOS and BlackBerry OS also use the
                  marketplace model, but what is unique to Android is the
                  existence of a plethora of alternative application markets.
                  This complicates the task of detecting and tracking Android
                  malware. Identifying a malicious application in one
                  particular market is simply not enough, as many instances of
                  this application may exist in other markets. To quantify this
                  phenomenon, we exhaustively crawled 8 markets between June
                  and November 2013. Our findings indicate that alternative
                  markets host a large number of ad-aggressive apps, a
                  non-negligible amount of malware, and some markets even allow
                  authors to publish known malicious apps without prompt
                  action. Motivated by these findings, we present AndRadar, a
                  framework for discovering multiple instances of a malicious
                  Android application in a set of alternative application
                  markets. AndRadar scans a set of markets in parallel to
                  discover similar applications. Each lookup takes no more than
                  a few seconds, regardless of the size of the marketplace.
                  Moreover, it is modular, and new markets can be transparently
                  added once the search and download URLs are known. Using
                  AndRadar we are able to achieve three goals. First, we can
                  discover malicious applications in alternative markets,
                  second, we can expose app distribution strategies used by
                  malware developers, and third, we can monitor how different
                  markets react to new malware. During a three-month evaluation
                  period, AndRadar tracked over 20,000 apps and recorded more
                  than 1,500 app deletions in 16 markets. Nearly 8\% of those
                  deletions were related to apps that were hopping from market
                  to market. The most established markets were able to react
                  and delete new malware within tens of days from the malicious
                  app publication date while other markets did not react at
                  all.},

                  to build resilient command-and-control infrastructures. Given
                  the prevalence of this mechanism, recent work has focused on
                  the analysis of DNS traffic to recognize botnets based on
                  their DGAs. While previous work has concentrated on
                  detection, we focus on supporting intelligence operations. We
                  propose Phoenix, a mechanism that, in addition to telling
                  DGA- and non-DGA-generated domains apart using a combination
                  of string and IP-based features, characterizes the DGAs

                  DGA-generated domains that are representative of the
                  respective botnets. As a result, Phoenix can associate
                  previously unknown DGA-generated domains to these groups, and
                  produce novel knowledge about the evolving behavior of each
                  tracked botnet. We evaluated Phoenix on 1,153,516 domains,
                  including DGA-generated domains from modern, well-known
                  botnets: without supervision, it correctly distinguished DGA-
                  vs. non-DGA-generated domains in 94.8 percent of the cases,
                  characterized families of domains that belonged to distinct
                  DGAs, and helped researchers ``on the field'' in gathering

                  statistical meaning that provide the analyst with an
                  easy-to-understand model of each customer's spending habits.
                  First, we quantify the anomaly of each transaction with
                  respect to the customer historical profile. Second, we find

                  Recent works focus on recognizing automatically generated
                  domains (AGDs) from DNS traffic, which potentially allows to
                  identify previously unknown AGDs to hinder or disrupt
                  botnets' communication capabilities. The state-of-the-art
                  approaches require to deploy low-level DNS sensors to access
                  data whose collection poses practical and privacy issues,
                  making their adoption problematic. We propose a mechanism
                  that overcomes the above limitations by analyzing DNS traffic
                  data through a combination of linguistic and IP-based
                  features of suspicious domains. In this way, we are able to
                  identify AGD names, characterize their DGAs and isolate
                  logical groups of domains that represent the respective
                  botnets. Moreover, our system enriches these groups with new,
                  previously unknown AGD names, and produce novel knowledge
                  about the evolving behavior of each tracked botnet. We used
                  our system in real-world settings, to help researchers that
                  requested intelligence on suspicious domains and were able to
                  label them as belonging to the correct botnet automatically.
                  Additionally, we ran an evaluation on 1,153,516 domains,
                  including AGDs from both modern (e.g., Bamital) and
                  traditional (e.g., Conficker, Torpig) botnets. Our approach
                  correctly isolated families of AGDs that belonged to distinct
                  DGAs, and set automatically generated from non-automatically

                  long URLs using limited space, by creating compact URL
                  aliases that redirect users to the original URLs when
                  followed. Some of these services show advertisements (ads) to
                  link-clicking users and pay a commission of their advertising
                  earnings to link-shortening users. In this paper, we
                  investigate the ecosystem of these increasingly popular
                  ad-based URL shortening services. Even though traditional URL
                  shortening services have been thoroughly investigated in
                  previous research, we argue that, due to the monetary
                  incentives and the presence of third-party advertising
                  networks, ad-based URL shortening services and their users
                  are exposed to more hazards than traditional shortening
                  services. By analyzing the services themselves, the
                  advertisers involved, and their users, we uncover a series of
                  issues that are actively exploited by malicious advertisers
                  and endanger the users. Moreover, next to documenting the
                  ongoing abuse, we suggest a series of defense mechanisms that
                  services and users can adopt to protect themselves.},

                  currency system, allows users to benefit from pseudonymity,
                  by generating an arbitrary number of aliases (or addresses)
                  to move funds. However, the complete history of all
                  transactions ever performed, called "blockchain", is public
                  and replicated on each node. The data it contains is
                  difficult to analyze manually, but can yield a high number of
                  relevant information.
                  
                  In this paper we present a modular framework, BitIodine,
                  which parses the blockchain, clusters addresses that are
                  likely to belong to a same user or group of users, classifies
                  such users and labels them, and finally visualizes complex
                  information extracted from the Bitcoin network.
                  
                  BitIodine labels users (semi-)automatically with information
                  on their identity and actions which is automatically scraped
                  from openly available information sources. BitIodine also
                  supports manual investigation by finding paths and reverse
                  paths between addresses or users.
                  
                  We tested BitIodine on several real-world use cases,
                  identified an address likely to belong to the encrypted Silk
                  Road cold wallet, or investigated the CryptoLocker ransomware
                  and accurately quantified the number of ransoms paid, as well
                  as information about the victims.
                  
                  We release an early prototype of BitIodine as a library for
                  building more complex Bitcoin forensic analysis tools.},

  abstract      = {Popularity and complexity of malicious mobile applications
                  are rising, making their analysis difficult and labor
                  intensive. Mobile application analysis is indeed inherently
                  different from desktop application analysis: In the latter,
                  the interaction of the user (i.e., victim) is crucial for the
                  malware to correctly expose all its malicious behaviors. We
                  propose a novel approach to analyze (malicious) mobile
                  applications. The goal is to exercise the user interface (UI)
                  of an Android application to effectively trigger malicious
                  behaviors, automatically. Our key intuition is to record and
                  reproduce the UI interactions of a potential victim of the
                  malware, so as to stimulate the relevant behaviors during
                  dynamic analysis. To make our approach scale, we
                  automatically re-execute the recorded UI interactions on apps
                  that are similar to the original ones. These characteristics
                  make our system orthogonal and complementary to current
                  dynamic analysis and UI-exercising approaches. We developed
                  our approach and experimentally shown that our stimulation
                  allows to reach a higher code coverage than automatic UI
                  exercisers, so to unveil interesting malicious behaviors that
                  are not exposed when using other approaches. Our approach is
                  also suitable for crowdsourcing scenarios, which would push
                  further the collection of new stimulation traces. This can
                  potentially change the way we conduct dynamic analysis of
                  (mobile) applications, from fully automatic only, to
                  user-centric and collaborative too.},

                  traditional drives, as they incorporate data-optimization
                  mechanisms to overcome their limitations (such as a limited
                  number of program-erase cycles, or the need of blanking a
                  block before writing). The most common optimizations are wear
                  leveling, trimming, compression, and garbage collection,
                  which operate transparently to the host OS and, in certain
                  cases, even when the disks are disconnected from a computer
                  (but still powered up). In simple words, SSD controllers are
                  designed to hide these internals completely, rendering them
                  inaccessible if not through direct acquisition of the memory
                  cells. These optimizations have a significant impact on the
                  forensic analysis of SSDs. The main cause is that memory
                  cells could be pre-emptively blanked, whereas a traditional
                  drive sector would need to be explicitly rewritten to
                  physically wipe off the data. Unfortunately, the existing
                  literature on this subject is sparse and the conclusions are
                  seemingly contradictory. In this paper we propose a generic,
                  practical, test-driven methodology that guides researchers
                  and forensics analysts through a series of steps that assess
                  the "forensic friendliness" of a SSD. Given a drive of the
                  same brand and model of the one under analysis, our
                  methodology produces a decision that helps an analyst to
                  determine whether or not an expensive direct acquisition of
                  the memory cells is worth the effort, because the extreme
                  optimizations may have rendered the data unreadable or
                  useless. We apply our methodology to three SSDs produced by
                  top vendors (Samsung, Corsair, and Crucial), and provide a
                  detailed description of how each step should be conducted.},

                  variants is increasing. This trend is mainly due to the fact

                  additional burden for the smartphone's battery power, which
                  is a precious resource. This observation motivates the need
                  for smarter (security) applications, designed and capable of
                  running within adaptive energy goals. Although this problem
                  affects other areas, in the security area this research
                  direction is referred to as "green security". In general, a
                  fundamental need to the researches toward creating
                  energy-aware applications, consist in having appropriate
                  power models that capture the full dynamic of devices and
                  users. This is not an easy task because of the highly dynamic
                  environment and usage habits. In practice, this goal requires
                  easy mechanisms to measure the power consumption and
                  approaches to create accurate models. The existing approaches
                  that tackle this problem are either not accurate or not
                  applicable in practice due to their limiting requirements. We
                  propose MPower, a power-sensing platform and adaptive power
                  modeling platform for Android mobile devices. The MPower
                  approach creates an adequate and precise knowledge base of
                  the power "behavior" of several different devices and users,
                  which allows us to create better device-centric power models
                  that considers the main hardware components and how they
                  contributed to the overall power consumption. In this paper
                  we consolidate our perspective work on MPower by providing
                  the implementation details and evaluation on 278 users and
                  about 22.5 million power-related data. Also, we explain how
                  MPower is useful in those scenarios where low-power,
                  unobtrusive, accurate power modeling is necessary (e.g.,
                  green security applications).},

                  However, it is still unclear whether they are an effective
                  and reliable tool that can be leveraged to hide malicious
                  URLs, and to what extent these abuses can impact the end
                  users. With these questions in mind, we first analyzed
                  existing countermeasures adopted by popular shortening
                  services. Surprisingly, we found such countermeasures to be
                  ineffective and trivial to bypass. This first measurement
                  motivated us to proceed further with a large-scale collection
                  of the HTTP interactions that originate when web users access
                  live pages that contain short URLs. To this end, we monitored
                  622 distinct URL shortening services between March 2010 and
                  April 2012, and collected 24,953,881 distinct short URLs.
                  With this large dataset, we studied the abuse of short URLs.
                  Despite short URLs are a significant, new security risk, in
                  accordance with the reports resulting from the observation of
                  the overall phishing and spamming activity, we found that
                  only a relatively small fraction of users ever encountered
                  malicious short URLs. Interestingly, during the second year
                  of measurement, we noticed an increased percentage of short
                  URLs being abused for drive-by download campaigns and a
                  decreased percentage of short URLs being abused for spam
                  campaigns. In addition to these security-related findings,
                  our unique monitoring infrastructure and large dataset
                  allowed us to complement previous research on short URLs and
                  analyze these web services from the user's perspective.},

                  services to prevent adversaries from compromising accounts

                  two-factor authentication mechanism, referred to as Social
                  Authentication, which requires users to identify some of
                  their friends in randomly selected photos. A recent study has
                  provided a formal analysis of social authentication
                  weaknesses against attackers inside the victim's social

                  show how any attacker can obtain the information needed to
                  solve the challenges presented by Facebook. We implement a
                  proof-of-concept system that utilizes widely available face

                  thus plays an essential role in the underground economy of
                  cyber-crime. Malware authors regularly update their software
                  to defeat defenses or to support new or improved criminal
                  business models. A large body of research has focused on
                  detecting malware, defending against it and identifying its
                  functionality. In addition to these goals, however, the
                  analysis of malware can provide a glimpse into the software
                  development industry that develops malicious code. In this
                  work, we present techniques to observe the evolution of a
                  malware family over time. First, we develop techniques to
                  compare versions of malicious code and quantify their

                  dynamic analysis to assign semantics to binary code and to
                  identify functional components within a malware binary. By
                  combining these techniques, we are able to monitor the

                  creates a non-negligible attack surface, which extends even
                  more when vehicles are integrated with smartphones to offer
                  advanced services. In fact, embedded systems on vehicles have
                  been developed to address safety, not security requirements.
                  Furthermore, vehicles have real-time constraints, and the
                  typical embedded architectures used on board significantly
                  complicate security designs. In this paper, we introduce a
                  communication framework that addresses these challenges and
                  we demonstrate how a smartphone can interact with a vehicle
                  in a secure and safe manner. To this end, we design a
                  security session layer that ensures end-to-end security
                  transparently. We conduct an experimental evaluation on a
                  real implementation of our security layer, which shows that
                  our solution is practical and easy to use, satisfies
                  performance constraints, and meets real-time requirements by
                  taking into account the limited capabilities of our target
                  architecture. More precisely, we implement our approach for
                  an electrically-powered two-wheeler manufactured by Piaggio,
                  and show how a smartphone can interact via a wireless link
                  with the battery-life controller in a secure manner.
                  Interestingly, our approach is not limited to vehicles, but
                  can be used in other application domains where a smartphone
                  needs to securely interact with an embedded device.},

                  discusses the results of a research that we have conducted
                  about the impact on users of short URLs. I describe a system
                  that we designed, implemented, and deployed that observes and
                  collects the short URLs that more than 7,000 real web users
                  have encountered while browsing the Web between March 2010
                  and April 2011 (and counting). On this dataset, which
                  comprises 16,075,693 distinct short URLs, we first precisely
                  characterized the usage habits observed during our collection
                  process, and the content typically referred by short URLs:
                  Users exhibit different usage habits depending on the type of
                  content they are using short URLs for. We then analyzed the
                  abuse of short URLs to hide the true URL of malicious pages:
                  This practice is not widespread, although we noticed that the
                  miscreants tend to post the same malicious short URL on
                  multiple pages. Finally, we analyzed the countermeasures of
                  shortening services against abuses of short URLs, and found
                  that they are trivially bypassed by shortening a benign URL
                  that turns malicious only a few moments after submitting it
                  to the shortening service.},

                  such as software behavioral analysis or malware
                  classification. During our doctoral research, we worked on
                  anomaly detection from three different perspective, as a
                  complex computer infrastructure has several weak spots that
                  must be protected. We first focused on the operating system,
                  central to any computer, to avoid malicious code to subvert
                  its normal activity. Secondly, we concentrated on web
                  applications, which are the main interface to modern
                  computing: Because of their immense popularity, they have
                  indeed become the most targeted entry point of intrusions.

                  This leads to confusion and difficulty more for researchers
                  than for practitioners for example, when comparing coverage
                  of different antivirus engines, when integrating and
                  systematizing known threats, or comparing the classifications
                  given by different detectors. Clearly, solving naming
                  inconsistencies is a very difficult task, as it requires that
                  vendors agree on a unified naming convention. More
                  importantly, solving inconsistencies is impossible without
                  knowing exactly where they are. Therefore, in this paper we
                  take a step back and concentrate on the problem of finding
                  inconsistencies. To this end, we first represent each
                  vendor's naming convention with a graph-based model. Second,
                  we give a precise definition of inconsistency with respect to
                  these models. Third, we define two quantitative measures to
                  calculate the overall degree of inconsistency between
                  vendors. In addition, we propose a fast algorithm that finds
                  non-trivial (i.e., beyond syntactic differences)
                  inconsistencies. Our experiments on four major antivirus
                  vendors and 98,798 real-world malware samples confirm
                  anecdotal observations that different vendors name viruses
                  differently. More importantly, we were able to find
                  inconsistencies that cannot be inferred at all by looking
                  solely at the syntax.},

                  exposing sensitive information on the go. In this paper, we
                  arise this concern by presenting an automatic attack against
                  modern touchscreen keyboards. We demonstrate the attack
                  against the Apple iPhone 2010's most popular touchscreen
                  device although it can be adapted to other devices (e.g.,
                  Android) that employ similar key-magnifying keyboards. Our
                  attack processes the stream of frames from a video camera
                  (e.g., surveillance or portable camera) and recognizes
                  keystrokes online, in a fraction of the time needed to
                  perform the same task by direct observation or offline
                  analysis of a recorded video, which can be unfeasible for
                  large amount of data. Our attack detects, tracks, and
                  rectifies the target touchscreen, thus following the device
                  or camera's movements and eliminating possible perspective

                  such an extent that attackers could steal sensitive
                  information by simply following the victim and observe his or
                  her portable device. We underline this concern by proposing
                  an automatic shoulder surfing attack against modern
                  touchscreen keyboards that display magnified keys in
                  predictable positions. We demonstrate this attack against the
                  Apple iPhone although it can work with other layouts and
                  different devices and show that it recognizes up to 97.07\%
                  (91.03\% on average) of the keystrokes, with only 1.15\% of
                  errors, at 37 to 51 keystrokes per minute: About eight times
                  faster than a human analyzing a recorded video. Our attack
                  accurately recovers the sequence of keystrokes input by the
                  user. A previous attack, which targeted desktop scenarios and
                  thus worked with very restrictive settings, is similar in
                  spirit to ours. However, as it assumes that camera and target
                  keyboard are both in fixed, perpendicular position, it cannot
                  suite mobile settings, characterized by moving target and
                  skewed, rotated viewpoints. Our attack, instead, requires no
                  particular settings and even allows for natural movements of
                  both target device and shoulder surfer's camera. In addition,
                  our attack yields accurate output without any grammar or
                  syntax checks, so that it can detect large context-free text
                  or non-dictionary words.},

                  bringing to life the concept of ``utility computing''. The
                  nostalgics observed a parallel between the emerging paradigm
                  of cloud computing and the traditional time-sharing era,
                  depicting clouds as the modern reincarnation of mainframes
                  available on a pay-per-use basis, and equipped with virtual,
                  elastic, disks-as-a-service that replace the old physical
                  disks with quotas. This comparison is fascinating, but more
                  importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground for
                  constructive critiques regarding the security of such a
                  computing paradigm and, especially, one of its key
                  components: web services. In this paper we discuss our
                  position about the current countermeasures (e.g., intrusion
                  detection systems, anti-malware), developed to mitigate
                  well-known web security threats. By reasoning on said
                  affinities, we focus on the simple case study of
                  anomaly-based approaches, which are employed in many modern
                  protection tools, not just in intrusion detectors. We
                  illustrate our position by the means of a simple running
                  example and show that attacks against injection
                  vulnerabilities, a widespread menace that is easily
                  recognizable with ordinary anomaly-based checks, can be
                  difficult to detect if web services are protected as they
                  were regular web applications. Along this line, we
                  concentrate on a few, critical hypotheses that demand
                  particular attention. Although in this emerging landscape
                  only a minority of threats qualify as novel, they could be
                  difficult to recognize with the current countermeasures and
                  thus can expose web services to new attacks. We conclude by
                  proposing simple modifications to the current countermeasures
                  to cope with the aforesaid security issues.},

  abstract      = {Phishers nowadays rely on a variety of channels, ranging
                  from old-fashioned emails to instant messages, social
                  networks, and the phone system (with both calls and text
                  messages), with the goal of reaching more victims. As a
                  consequence, modern phishing became a multi-faceted, even
                  more pervasive threat that is inherently more difficult to
                  study than traditional, email-based phishing. This short
                  paper describes the status of a data collection system we are
                  developing to capture different aspects of phishing
                  campaigns, with a particular focus on the emerging use of the
                  voice channel. The general approach is to record inbound
                  calls received on decoy phone lines, place outbound calls to
                  the same caller identifiers (when available) and also to
                  telephone numbers obtained from different sources.
                  Specifically, our system analyzes instant messages (e.g.,
                  automated social engineering attempts) and suspicious emails
                  (e.g., spam, phishing), and extracts telephone numbers, URLs
                  and popular words from the content. In addition, users can
                  voluntarily submit voice phishing (vishing) attempts through
                  a public website. Extracted telephone numbers, URLs and
                  popular words will be correlated to recognize campaigns by
                  means of cross-channel relationships between messages.},

                  experiencing changes that, regardless of some skepticism, are
                  bringing to life the concept of ``utility computing''. The
                  nostalgics observed a parallel between the emerging paradigm
                  of cloud computing and the traditional time-sharing era,
                  depicting clouds as the modern reincarnation of mainframes
                  available on a pay-per-use basis, and equipped with virtual,
                  elastic, paid disks-as-a-service that replace the old
                  physical disks with quotas. This comparison is fascinating,
                  but more importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground
                  for constructive critiques regarding the security of such
                  computing paradigm. In this paper we explore similar
                  analogies to discuss our position about the current
                  countermeasures (e.g., intrusion detection systems,
                  anti-viruses), developed to mitigate well-known security
                  threats. By reasoning on said affinities, we focus on the
                  simple case of anomaly-based approaches, which are employed
                  in many modern protection tools, not just in intrusion
                  detectors. We illustrate our position by the means of a
                  simple running example and show that attacks against
                  injection vulnerabilities, a current menace that is easily
                  recognizable with ordinary anomaly-based checks, can be
                  difficult to detect if web services are assumed to be regular
                  web applications. Along this line, we concentrate on a few,
                  critical hypotheses that demand particular attention. We
                  conclude that, although only a minority of threats qualify as
                  novel, they are well camouflaged and can be difficult to
                  recognize behind the confusion caused by the cloud computing
                  excitement.},

  abstract      = {Spying on a person is a subtle, yet easy and reliable method
                  to obtain sensitive information. Even if the victim is well
                  protected from digital attacks, spying may be a viable
                  option. In addition, the pervasiveness of mobile devices
                  increases an attacker's opportunities to observe the victims
                  while they are accessing or entering sensitive information.
                  This risk is exacerbated by the remarkable user-friendliness
                  of modern, mobile graphical interfaces, which, for example,
                  display visual feedback to improve the user experience and
                  make common tasks, \$\ensuremath{\backslash}backslash\$eg,
                  typing, more natural. Unfortunately, this turns into the
                  well-known trade-off between usability and security. In this
                  work, we focus on how usability of modern mobile interfaces
                  may affect the users' privacy. In particular, we describe a
                  practical eavesdropping attack, able to recognize the
                  sequence of keystrokes from a low-resolution video, recorded
                  while the victim is typing on a touchscreen. Our attack
                  exploits the fact that modern virtual keyboards, as opposed
                  to mechanical ones, often display magnified, virtual keys in
                  predictable positions. To demonstrate the feasibility of this
                  attack we implemented it against 2010's most popular
                  smart-phone (i.e., Apple's iPhone). Our approach works under
                  realistic conditions, because it tracks and rectifies the
                  target screen according to the victim's natural movements,
                  before performing the keystroke recognition. On real-world
                  settings, our attack can automatically recognize up to
                  97.07\% (91.03\% on average) of the keystrokes, with a 1.15\%
                  error rate and a speed between 37 and 51 keystrokes per
                  minute. This work confirms that touchscreen keyboards that
                  magnify keys make automatic eavesdropping attacks easier than
                  in classic mobile keyboards.},

                  technologies (e.g., e-mailing) to spread social engineering
                  attacks with the goal of persuading a large amount of victims
                  into voluntarily disclose sensitive data. Phishing based on
                  e-mail and web technologies is certainly the most popular
                  form. It has indeed received ample attention and some
                  mitigation measures have been implemented. In this paper we
                  describe our study on vishing (voice phishing), a form of
                  phishing where the scammers exploit the phone channel to ask
                  for sensitive information, rather than sending e-mails and
                  cloning trustworthy websites. In some sense, the traditional
                  ala-Mitnick phone scams are streamlined by attackers using
                  techniques that are typical of modern, e-mail-based phishing.
                  We detail our analysis of an embryonic, real-world database
                  of vishing attacks reported by victims through a
                  publicly-available web application that we build for this
                  purpose. The vishing activity that we registered in our
                  preliminary analysis is targeted against the U.S. customers.
                  According to our samples, we analyzed to what extent the
                  criminals rely on automated responders to streamline the
                  vishing campaigns. In addition, we analyzed the content of
                  the conversations and found that words such as ``credit'',
                  ``press'' (a key) or ``account'' are fairly popular. In
                  addition, we describe the data collection infrastructure and
                  motivate why gathering data about vishing is more difficult
                  than for regular e-mail phishing.},

                  effective black-box technique for detecting unknown attacks.
                  However, the effectiveness of this technique crucially
                  depends upon both the quality and the completeness of the
                  training data. Unfortunately, in most cases, the traffic to
                  the system (e.g., a web application or daemon process)
                  protected by an anomaly detector is not uniformly
                  distributed. Therefore, some components (e.g.,
                  authentication, payments, or content publishing) might not be
                  exercised enough to train an anomaly detection system in a
                  reasonable time frame. This is of particular importance in
                  real-world settings, where anomaly detection systems are
                  deployed with little or no manual configuration, and they are
                  expected to automatically learn the normal behavior of a
                  system to detect or block attacks. In this work, we first
                  demonstrate that the features utilized to train a
                  learning-based detector can be semantically grouped, and that
                  features of the same group tend to induce similar models.
                  Therefore, we propose addressing local training data
                  deficiencies by exploiting clustering techniques to construct
                  a knowledge base of well-trained models that can be utilized
                  in case of undertraining. Our approach, which is independent
                  of the particular type of anomaly detector employed, is
                  validated using the realistic case of a learning-based system
                  protecting a pool of web servers running several web
                  applications such as blogs, forums, or Web services. We run
                  our experiments on a real-world data set containing over 58
                  million HTTP requests to more than 36,000 distinct web
                  application components. The results show that by using the
                  proposed solution, it is possible to achieve effective attack
                  detection even with scarce training data.},

                  techniques, that are central to several classic
                  security-related tasks such as network monitoring, but it
                  also have broader applications such as program behavior
                  characterization or malware classification. In particular, we
                  worked on anomaly detection from three different perspective,
                  with the common goal of recognizing awkward activity on
                  computer infrastructures. In fact, a computer system has
                  several weak spots that must be protected to avoid attackers
                  to take advantage of them. We focused on protecting the
                  operating system, central to any computer, to avoid malicious
                  code to subvert its normal activity. Secondly, we
                  concentrated on protecting the web applications, which can be
                  considered the modern, shared operating systems; because of
                  their immense popularity, they have indeed become the most
                  targeted entry point to violate a system. Last, we
                  experimented with novel techniques with the aim of
                  identifying related events (e.g., alerts reported by
                  intrusion detection systems) to build new and more compact
                  knowledge to detect malicious activity on large-scale
                  systems.
                  
                  Our contributions regarding host-based protection systems
                  focus on characterizing a process' behavior through the
                  system calls invoked into the kernel. In particular, we
                  engineered and carefully tested different versions of a
                  multi-model detection system using both stochastic and
                  deterministic models to capture the features of the system
                  calls during normal operation of the operating system.
                  Besides demonstrating the effectiveness of our approaches, we
                  confirmed that the use of finite-state, deterministic models
                  allow to detect deviations from the process' control flow
                  with the highest accuracy; however, our contribution combine
                  this effectiveness with advanced models for the system calls'
                  arguments resulting in a significantly decreased number of
                  false alarms.
                  
                  Our contributions regarding web-based protection systems
                  focus on advanced training procedures to enable learning
                  systems to perform well even in presence of changes in the
                  web application source code---particularly frequent in the
                  Web 2.0 era. We also addressed data scarcity issues that is a
                  real problem when deploying an anomaly detector to protect a
                  new, never-used-before application. Both these issues
                  dramatically decrease the detection capabilities of an
                  intrusion detection system but can be effectively mitigated
                  by adopting the techniques we propose.
                  
                  Last, we investigated the use of different stochastic and
                  fuzzy models to perform automatic alert correlation, which is
                  as post processing step to intrusion detection. We proposed a
                  fuzzy model that formally defines the errors that inevitably
                  occur if time-based alert aggregation (i.e., two alerts are
                  considered correlated if they are close in time) is used.
                  This model allow to account for measurements errors and avoid
                  false correlations due to delays, for instance, or incorrect
                  parameter settings. In addition, we defined a model to
                  describe the alert generation as a stochastic process and
                  experimented with non-parametric statistical tests to define
                  robust, zero-configuration correlation systems.
                  
                  The aforementioned tools have been tested over different
                  datasets---that are thoroughly documented in this
                  document---and lead to interesting results.},

                  implement protection mechanisms for various systems.
                  Recently, these approaches have been ported to the web domain
                  under the name of ``web application anomaly detectors'' (or
                  firewalls) with promising results. In particular, those
                  capable of automatically building specifications, or models,
                  of the protected application by observing its traffic (e.g.,
                  network packets, system calls, or HTTP requests and
                  responses) are particularly interesting, since they can be
                  deployed with little effort. Typically, the detection
                  accuracy of these systems is significantly influenced by the
                  model building phase (often called training), which clearly
                  depends upon the quality of the observed traffic, which
                  should resemble the normal activity of the protected
                  application and must be also free from attacks. Otherwise,
                  detection may result in significant amounts of false
                  positives (i.e., benign events flagged as anomalous) and
                  negatives (i.e., undetected threats). In this work we
                  describe Masibty, a web application anomaly detector that
                  have some interesting properties. First, it requires the
                  training data not to be attack-free. Secondly, not only it
                  protects the monitored application, it also detects and
                  blocks malicious client-side threats before they are sent to
                  the browser. Third, Masibty intercepts the queries before
                  they are sent to the database, correlates them with the
                  corresponding HTTP requests and blocks those deemed
                  anomalous. Both the accuracy and the performance have been
                  evaluated on real-world web applications with interesting
                  results. The system is almost not influenced by the presence
                  of attacks in the training data and shows only a negligible
                  amount of false positives, although this is paid in terms of
                  a slight performance overhead.},

                  detection systems that leverage machine learning techniques
                  are particularly well-suited for protecting websites. The
                  reason is that these systems are able to characterize the
                  applications' normal behavior in an automated fashion.
                  However, anomaly-based detectors for web applications suffer
                  from false positives that are generated whenever the
                  applications being protected change. These false positives
                  need to be analyzed by the security officer who then has to
                  interact with the web application developers to confirm that
                  the reported alerts were indeed erroneous detections. In this
                  paper, we propose a novel technique for the automatic
                  detection of changes in web applications, which allows for
                  the selective retraining of the affected anomaly detection

                  legitimate changes in web applications, we can reduce false
                  positives and allow for the automated retraining of the
                  anomaly models. We have evaluated our approach by analyzing a
                  number of real-world applications. Our analysis shows that
                  web applications indeed change substantially over time, and
                  that our technique is able to effectively detect changes and
                  automatically adapt the anomaly detection models to the new
                  structure of the changed web applications.},
