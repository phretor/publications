  abstract	= {We describe our experience gained while exploring
		  practical security and privacy problems in a real-world,
		  large- scale social network (i.e., Facebook), and summarize
		  our conclusions in a series of "lessons learned". We first
		  conclude that it is better to adequately describe the
		  potential ethical concerns from the very beginning and plan
		  ahead the institutional review board (IRB) request. Even
		  though sometimes optional, the IRB approval is a valuable
		  point from the reviewer's perspective. Another aspect that
		  needs planning is getting in touch with the online social
		  network security team, which takes a substantial amount of
		  time. With their support, "bending the rules" (e.g., using
		  scrapers) when the experimental goals require so, is
		  easier. Clearly, in cases where critical technical
		  vulnerabilities are found during the research, the general
		  recommendations for responsible disclosure should be
		  followed. Gaining the audience's engagement and trust was
		  essential to the success of our user study. Participants
		  felt more comfortable when subscribing to our experiments,
		  and also responsibly reported bugs and glitches. We did not
		  observe the same behavior in crowd-sourcing workers, who
		  were instead more interested in obtaining their rewards. On
		  a related point, our experience suggests that crowd
		  sourcing should not be used alone: Setting up tasks is more
		  time consuming than it seems, and researchers must insert
		  some sentinel checks to ensure that workers are not
		  submitting random answers.From a logistics point of view,
		  we learned that having at least a high-level plan of the
		  experiments pays back, especially when the IRB requires a
		  detailed description of the work and the data to be
		  collected. However, over planning can be dangerous because
		  the measurement goals can change dynamically. From a
		  technical point of view, partially connected to the
		  logistics remarks, having a complex and large
		  data-gathering and analysis framework may be
		  counterproductive in terms of set-up a- d management
		  overhead. From our experience we suggest to choose simple
		  technologies that scale up if needed but, more importantly,
		  can scale down. For example, launching a quick query should
		  be straightforward, and the frameworks should not impose
		  too much overhead for formulating it. We conclude with a
		  series of practical recommendations on how to successfully
		  collect data from online social networks (e.g., using
		  techniques for network multipresence, mimicking user
		  behavior, and other crawling "tricks"') and avoid abusing
		  the online service, while gathering the data required by
		  the experiments.},

  abstract	= {Although there are controversial opinions regarding how
		  large the mobile malware phenomenon is in terms of absolute
		  numbers, hype aside, the amount of new Android malware
		  variants is increasing. This trend is mainly due to the
		  fact that, as it happened with traditional malware, the
		  authors are striving to repackage, obfuscate, or otherwise
		  transform the executable code of their malicious apps in
		  order to evade mobile security apps. There are about 85 of
		  these apps only on the official marketplace. However, it is
		  not clear how effective they are. Indeed, the sandboxing
		  mechanism of Android does not allow (security) apps to
		  audit other apps. We present AndroTotal, a publicly
		  available tool, malware repository and research framework
		  that aims at mitigating the above challenges, and allow
		  researchers to automatically scan Android apps against an
		  arbitrary set of malware detectors. We implemented
		  AndroTotal and released it to the research community in
		  April 2013. So far, we collected 18,758 distinct submitted
		  samples and received the attention of several research
		  groups (1,000 distinct accounts), who integrated their
		  malware-analysis services with ours.},

  abstract	= {Phishers nowadays rely on a variety of channels, ranging
		  from old-fashioned emails to instant messages, social
		  networks, and the phone system (with both calls and text
		  messages), with the goal of reaching more victims. As a
		  consequence, modern phishing became a multi-faceted, even
		  more pervasive threat that is inherently more difficult to
		  study than traditional, email-based phishing. This short
		  paper describes the status of a data collection system we
		  are developing to capture different aspects of phishing
		  campaigns, with a particular focus on the emerging use of
		  the voice channel. The general approach is to record
		  inbound calls received on decoy phone lines, place outbound
		  calls to the same caller identifiers (when available) and
		  also to telephone numbers obtained from different sources.
		  Specifically, our system analyzes instant messages (e.g.,
		  automated social engineering attempts) and suspicious
		  emails (e.g., spam, phishing), and extracts telephone
		  numbers, URLs and popular words from the content. In
		  addition, users can voluntarily submit voice phishing
		  (vishing) attempts through a public website. Extracted
		  telephone numbers, URLs and popular words will be
		  correlated to recognize campaigns by means of cross-channel
		  relationships between messages.},
