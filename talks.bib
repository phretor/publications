                  Machine-to-Machine Data Protocols},
  eventtitle    = {{Black Hat Briefings Europe}},
  abstract      = {Two popular machine-to-machine (M2M) protocols—MQTT \&
                  CoAP—are slowly forming the backbone of many IoT
                  infrastructures, including critical industry environments.
                  They are used to provide data connectivity for practically
                  any kind of "machines". We found out that these protocols are
                  affected by security and privacy issues that impact several
                  market verticals, applications, products, and brands.
                  
                  This talk provides a security analysis of MQTT \& CoAP at the
                  design, implementation, and deployment level. We found issues
                  in the design specifications, vulnerable product
                  implementations, and hundreds of thousands unsecured,
                  open-to-the-world deployments. These issues show the risk
                  that endpoints could be open to denial-of-service attacks
                  and, in some cases, full control by an adversary. Despite the
                  fixes in the design specifications, it is hard for developers
                  to keep up with a changing standard when a technology becomes
                  pervasive. Also, the market of this technology is very wide
                  because the barrier to entry is fairly low. This led to a
                  multitude of fragmented implementations.
                  
                  We analyzed the source code of the most common MQTT
                  implementations, and discovered common flaws—mostly
                  originating from misinterpretation of the standard. In
                  particular, we found issues in how multibyte strings, UTF-8
                  characters, and regular-expressions are parsed. Combined with
                  standard features that force servers to retain messages and
                  clients to request acknowledgement the delivery of every
                  message, such bugs can lead to persistent denial of service.
                  Our findings have been acknowledged by the MQTT Technical
                  Committee, which released a note to help identify the risks.
                  
                  Alongside this, we've analyzed hundreds of millions MQTT \&
                  CoAP messages obtained from hundreds of thousands server.
                  Despite previous efforts that tried to raise awareness, we
                  still found exposed data related to various industry sectors
                  and sensitive information, including credentials and network
                  infrastructure details. Moreover, we found out that MQTT is
                  being used beyond messaging, to transport binary data, most
                  likely for OTA update purposes, which certainly raises a red
                  flag.
                  
                  Using MQTT \& CoAP as a concrete example of modern M2M
                  technology, we will provide recommendations at various levels
                  (standardization bodies, vendors, developers, and users) in
                  the hope to see a significant reduction in the number of
                  insecure deployments in the future, and a more responsible
                  position by standardization bodies.},

                  industrial machines will continue to exist. In terms of
                  cybersecurity risks, what happens when these machines must be
                  connected? We've answered this question by taking a close
                  look at a previous-generation industrial robot, one of the
                  most widespread industrial machine, used practically in every
                  sector, including for manufacturing. Besides the software
                  vulnerabilities that we have found, which we consider
                  "natural" in embedded software, we focused on the root cause
                  of these vulnerabilities and we will discuss our thoughts and
                  practical recommendations with the audience. We will provide
                  a demo of what happens when an attacker compromises an
                  industrial robot, explaining how a software flaw can go all
                  the way down to affecting the quality of the manufactured
                  goods. Beyond robots, the entire factory features more and
                  more embedded systems, which are a critical entry point for
                  an external attacker, and thus need to properly be secured.},

  abstract      = {The security industry as a whole---including operation
                  centers, providers and telcos---loves collecting data.
                  Researchers are not different! A sort of common feeling is
                  that the more data someone collects, the more self-confident
                  he becomes about, say, a threat or another phenomenon.
                  However, large volumes of data imply more processing
                  resources needed, especially in extracting meaningful and
                  useful information if the data is highly unstructured. As a
                  result, manual data analysis is often the only choice, with
                  security professionals like pen-testers, reversers and
                  analysts processing data through tedious repetitive
                  operations.
                  
                  Given this situation, and our research lab suffering from
                  similar problems, we have spent the first half of 2017
                  implementing a flexible toolkit based on open-source
                  libraries for efficiently analyzing millions of deface pages
                  and web incidents. Our tool, DefPloreX, uses a combination of
                  machine-learning and visualization techniques to practically
                  turn original unstructured data into meaningful high-level
                  descriptions. Real-time information on incidents, breaches,
                  attacks and vulnerabilities, for example, are efficiently
                  processed and condensed into objects that are easily
                  browsable -- making them suitable for efficient large-scale
                  eCrime forensics and investigations.
                  
                  DefPloreX ingests plain CSV inputs about web incidents to
                  analyze, explores their resources with headless browsers,
                  extracts features from deface pages, and uploads the
                  resulting data to an Elastic index. Distributed headless
                  browsers are coordinated via Celery. Using Python Panda,
                  NumPy and PyTables, DefPloreX provides offline "views" of the
                  data, allowing easy pivoting and exploration. Our toolkit
                  automatically groups similar deface pages in clusters and
                  organizes web incidents in campaigns. Requiring only one
                  pass, clustering is intrinsically parallel and not memory
                  bound. DefPloreX offers text- and web-based UIs, which can be
                  queried using a simple language for investigations and
                  forensics.},

                  mitigate the damage caused by modern ransomware attacks. The
                  remarkable amount of illicit profit and the cybercriminals'
                  increasing interest in ransomware schemes demonstrate that
                  current defense solutions are failing, and a large number of
                  users are actually paying the ransoms. In fact,
                  pure-detection approaches (e.g., based on analysis sandboxes
                  or pipelines) are not sufficient, because, when luck allows a
                  sample to be isolated and analyzed, it is already too late
                  for several users! Moreover, modern ransomware implements
                  several techniques to prevent detection by common AV.
                  Similarly, for performance reasons, backups leave a
                  small-but-important window of recent files unprotected.
                  
                  We believe that a forward-looking solution is to equip modern
                  operating systems with generic, practical self-healing
                  capabilities against this serious threat.
                  
                  In this talk, we will present ShieldFS, a drop-in driver that
                  makes the Windows native filesystem immune to ransomware
                  attacks, even when detection fails ShieldFS dynamically
                  toggles a protection layer that acts as a copy-on-write
                  mechanism whenever its detection component reveals suspicious
                  activity. For this, ShieldFS monitors the filesystem's
                  internals to update a set of adaptive models that profile the
                  system activity over time. This detection is based on a study
                  of the filesystem activity of over 2,245 applications, and
                  takes into account the entropy of write operations, frequency
                  of read, write, and folder-listing operations, fraction of
                  files renamed, and the file-type usage statistics.
                  Additionally, ShieldFS monitors the memory pages of each
                  "potentially malicious" process, searching for traces of the
                  typical block cipher key schedules.
                  
                  We will show how ShieldFS can shadow the write operations.
                  Whenever one or more processes violate our detection
                  component, their operations are deemed malicious and the side
                  effects on the filesystem are transparently rolled back.
                  
                  Last, we will demo how effective ShieldFS is against samples
                  from state of the art ransomware families, showing that it is
                  able to detect the malicious activity at runtime and
                  transparently recover all the original files.},

  abstract      = {Industrial robots are complex cyber-physical systems used
                  for manufacturing, and a critical component of any modern
                  factory. These robots aren't just electromechanical devices
                  but include complex embedded controllers, which are often
                  interconnected with other computers in the factory network,
                  safety systems, and to the Internet for remote monitoring and
                  maintenance. In this scenario, industrial routers also play a
                  key role, because they directly expose the robot's
                  controller. Therefore, the impact of a single, simple
                  vulnerability can grant attackers an easy entry point.
                  
                  Industrial robots must follow three fundamental laws:
                  accurately "read" from the physical world through sensors and
                  "write" (i.e. perform actions) through actuators, refuse to
                  execute self-damaging control logic, and most importantly,
                  echoing Asimov, never harm humans. By combining a set of
                  vulnerabilities we discovered on a real robot, we will
                  demonstrate how remote attackers are able to violate such
                  fundamental laws up to the point where they can alter the
                  manufactured product, physically damage the robot, steal
                  industry secrets, or injure humans.
                  
                  We will cover in-depth technical aspects (e.g., reverse
                  engineering and vulnerability details, and attack PoCs),
                  alongside a broader discussion on the security posture of
                  industrial routers and robots: Why these devices are
                  attractive for attackers? What could they achieve? Are they
                  hard to compromise? How can their security be improved?},

                  user's visited content across different devices to then push
                  relevant, more targeted content. For example, if a user
                  clicks on a particular advertisement while browsing the web
                  at home, the advertisers are very interested in collecting
                  this information to display, later on, related advertisements
                  on other devices belonging to the same user (e.g., phone,
                  tablet).
                  
                  Currently, the most recent innovation in this area is
                  ultrasonic cross-device tracking (uXDT), which is the use of
                  the ultrasonic spectrum as a communication channel to "pair"
                  devices for the aforementioned tracking purposes.
                  Technically, this pairing happens through a receiver
                  application installed on the phone or tablet. The business
                  model is that users will receive rewards or useful services
                  for keeping those apps active, pretty much like it happens
                  for proximity-marketing apps (e.g., Shopkick), where users
                  receive deals for walk-ins recorded by their
                  indoor-localizing apps.

                  security and privacy risks that arise with the adoption of
                  uXDT-enabled systems. The uXDT technology has caught the
                  attention of major companies (e.g., IDG Ventures, Google,
                  Nestle, Dominos), many of which either invested in uXDT
                  providers (e.g., SilverPush, Signal360, Audible Magic), or
                  approached such companies as clients. Unfortunately,
                  unbeknownst to the users, we found that numerous mobile
                  applications, some with millions of downloads, include uXDT
                  advertising frameworks that actively listen for ultrasounds,

                  the authorities (e.g., the Federal Trade Commission) have
                  promptly raised concerns about uXDT, but until now no
                  comprehensive security analysis of the technology has been
                  released.
                  
                  In this talk, we will explore the uXDT ecosystem, dig into
                  the inner workings of popular uXDT frameworks, and perform an
                  in-depth technical analysis of the underlying technology,
                  exposing both implementation \& design vulnerabilities, and
                  critical security \& privacy shortcomings that we discovered.
                  In the offensive part of our talk, we will demonstrate
                  (through practical demo sessions) how an attacker can exploit
                  uXDT frameworks to reveal the true IP addresses of users who
                  browse the Internet through anonymity networks (e.g., VPNs or
                  Tor). Moreover, we will describe how an attacker can tamper
                  with the "pairing" process or affect the results of the
                  advertising/bidding algorithms. For example, an attacker
                  equipped with a simple beacon-emitting device (e.g., a
                  smartphone) can walk into a Starbucks at peak hour and launch
                  a profile-corruption attack against all customers currently
                  taking advantage of uXDT-enabled apps.
                  
                  In the defensive part of our talk, we will introduce three
                  countermeasures that we designed, implemented, and will
                  publicly release. These include (1) a mobile application that
                  detects ultrasound beacons "in the air" with the goal of
                  raising awareness, (2) a browser extension that acts as a
                  personal firewall by selectively filtering ultrasonic
                  beacons, and (3) an brand-new OS permission control in
                  Android that allows applications to declaratively ask access
                  to the ultrasound spectrum. We will go into the technical
                  details and provide remediation advice useful both for the
                  users and developers.},

  abstract      = {While we have grown accustomed to stealthy malware,
                  specifically written to gain and maintain control of the
                  victim machines to abuse their resources, ransomware really
                  comes as a "plot twist"! After 10+ years of stealthy malware,
                  spread mainly for building botnets and steal information, for
                  the second time we're witnessing a growth of disruptive
                  malware, and an interest for direct and fast profit.
                  Ransomware is a particularly striking example of disruptive
                  malware, both on mobile and desktop targets: While
                  traditional mass malware must fly under the radar to fulfill
                  its goals, a ransomware attack that remains unaccountable has
                  failed miserably. It must show up to inform and frighten the
                  victim! As a result, the human psychological response to the
                  attack plays a significant role in the success of ransomware
                  schemes. And, given the remarkable revenue, the scheme seems
                  to be working fairly well.
                  
                  This talk will describe the technical impact of disruptive
                  malware and its game-changing approach, which made us (at
                  least) rethink our incident-response plans. We will focus on
                  mobile ransomware as a representative, extreme case study.
                  Albeit not very studied, we are currently tracking 10
                  distinct families, and collected tenths of thousands distinct
                  samples in three months. In this talk, we will go through the
                  most notorious families such as Koler, SLocker, Svpeng (and
                  mention the other notable ones), overviewing their
                  social-engineering tricks and how they are technically
                  implemented. This will include, for instance, how an app can
                  effectively lock a device to forcefully display the typical
                  threatening message that informs the victim of what just
                  happened, or how crypto and file-system APIs are (ab)used to
                  surreptitiously encrypt the valuable data.
                  
                  After having overviewed these aspects, we will describe how
                  they can be effectively detected with specific static
                  features. We will present a lightweight Smali emulator to
                  track the instruction sequences that implement device-locking
                  mechanisms. To detect malicious encryption attempts, we will
                  present a static, dataflow-based program-analysis technique
                  and tool that track file-system operations (e.g., file
                  listing, file reading) to determine if they are "connected"
                  to encryption flows. Since the most recent families have
                  started to abuse the device-administration API (e.g., to lock
                  the device), obfuscated method names and reflection to hinder
                  automatic static analysis, we will show a couple of
                  counter-tricks. Last, we will show how the threatening
                  messages can be recognized from normal text using a
                  language-analysis technique, which classifies text based on
                  the appearance of key terms frequently found in ransomware
                  samples but not in benign sources. Since static
                  program-analysis approaches like ours can be time and
                  resource consuming, we describe a fast triaging pre-filtering
                  technique to quickly discard strikingly benign applications.
                  This filter is generic and ransomware-agnostic. Thus, in
                  principle, it could be applied to any app-vetting pipeline.
                  
                  With this talk we will release the source code of a prototype
                  that implements (part of) the described techniques, and a
                  dataset comprising tenths of thousands of ransomware
                  applications targeting the Android platform, each labeled
                  with the set of features that characterize their
                  statically-extracted behavior.},

  abstract      = {Modern botnets rely on domain-generation algorithms (DGAs)
                  to build resilient command-and-control infrastructures.
                  Recent works focus on recognizing automatically generated
                  domains (AGDs) from DNS traffic, which potentially allows to
                  identify previously unknown AGDs to hinder or disrupt
                  botnets' communication capabilities. The state-of-the-art
                  approaches require to deploy low-level DNS sensors to access
                  data whose collection poses practical and privacy issues,
                  making their adoption problematic. We propose a mechanism
                  that overcomes the above limitations by analyzing DNS traffic
                  data through a combination of linguistic and IP-based
                  features of suspicious domains. In this way, we are able to
                  identify AGD names, characterize their DGAs and isolate
                  logical groups of domains that represent the respective
                  botnets. Moreover, our system enriches these groups with new,
                  previously unknown AGD names, and produce novel knowledge
                  about the evolving behavior of each tracked botnet. We used
                  our system in real-world settings, to help researchers that
                  requested intelligence on suspicious domains and were able to
                  label them as belonging to the correct botnet automatically.
                  Additionally, we ran an evaluation on 1,153,516 domains,
                  including AGDs from both modern (e.g., Bamital) and
                  traditional (e.g., Conficker, Torpig) botnets. Our approach
                  correctly isolated families of AGDs that belonged to distinct
                  DGAs, and set automatically generated from non-automatically
                  generated domains apart in 94.8 percent of the cases.},

  abstract      = {Two-factor authentication is widely used by high-value
                  services to prevent adversaries from compromising accounts
                  using stolen credentials. Facebook has recently released a
                  two-factor authentication mechanism, referred to as Social
                  Authentication, which requires users to identify some of
                  their friends in randomly selected photos. A recent study has
                  provided a formal analysis of social authentication
                  weaknesses against attackers inside the victim's social
                  circles. In this paper, we extend the threat model and study
                  the attack surface of social authentication in practice, and
                  show how any attacker can obtain the information needed to
                  solve the challenges presented by Facebook. We implement a
                  proof-of-concept system that utilizes widely available face
                  recognition software and cloud services, and evaluate it
                  using real public data collected from Facebook. Under the
                  assumptions of Facebook's threat model, our results show that
                  an attacker can obtain access to (sensitive) information for
                  at least 42\% of a user's friends that Facebook uses to
                  generate social authentication challenges. By relying solely
                  on publicly accessible information, a casual attacker can
                  solve 22\% of the social authentication tests in an automated
                  fashion, and gain a significant advantage for an additional
                  56\% of the tests, as opposed to just guessing. Additionally,
                  we simulate the scenario of a determined attacker placing
                  himself inside the victim's social circle by employing dummy
                  accounts. In this case, the accuracy of our attack greatly
                  increases and reaches 100\% when 120 faces per friend are
                  accessible by the attacker, even though it is very accurate
                  with as little as 10 faces.},

                  Royal Holloway University of London, in April 2012. This talk
                  discusses the results of a research that we have conducted
                  about the impact on users of short URLs. I describe a system
                  that we designed, implemented, and deployed that observes and
                  collects the short URLs that more than 7,000 real web users
                  have encountered while browsing the Web between March 2010
                  and April 2011 (and counting). On this dataset, which
                  comprises 16,075,693 distinct short URLs, we first precisely
                  characterized the usage habits observed during our collection
                  process, and the content typically referred by short URLs:
                  Users exhibit different usage habits depending on the type of
                  content they are using short URLs for. We then analyzed the
                  abuse of short URLs to hide the true URL of malicious pages:
                  This practice is not widespread, although we noticed that the
                  miscreants tend to post the same malicious short URL on
                  multiple pages. Finally, we analyzed the countermeasures of
                  shortening services against abuses of short URLs, and found
                  that they are trivially bypassed by shortening a benign URL
                  that turns malicious only a few moments after submitting it
                  to the shortening service.},

  title         = {{iSnoop}: How to Steal Secrets From Touchscreen Devices},
  eventtitle    = {{Black Hat Briefings Abu Dhabi}},
  abstract      = {Spying on a person is an easy and effective method to obtain
                  sensitive informations, even when the victim is well
                  protected against common digital attacks. Modern mobile
                  devices allow people to perform some information sensitive
                  actions in unsafe places, where anyone could easily observe
                  the victim while typing. What if your mobile phone has a cool
                  touchscreen interface that gives you graphical feedback as
                  you type (iPhone, Android, BlackBerry Torch)? Does it make
                  shoulder surfing easier or, worse, automatable?
                  
                  We believe so, and to demonstrate it, we developed a
                  practical shoulder surfing attack that automatically
                  reconstructs the sequence of keystrokes by aiming a camera at
                  the target touchscreen while the victim is typing. Our attack
                  exploits feedback such as magnified keys, often appearing in
                  predictable positions. This feedback mechanism has been
                  adopted by the top three touchscreen vendors (Apple iOS,
                  Google Android, RIM BlackBerry); in newer version of these
                  mobile OSs, the user has no way to disable it. To demonstrate
                  the effectiveness of our approach, we implemented it against
                  the iPhone (the most popular one), but it can be easily
                  adapted to similar devices with minor modifications.
                  
                  Our attack takes into account that, in real-world scenarios,
                  both the victim's device and attacker's spying camera are not
                  standing in fixed positions. To compensate their movements
                  and misalignments, our system detects and rectifies the
                  target screen before identifying keystokes. By doing that, we
                  are able to automatically recognize up to 97.07\% of the
                  keystrokes, with as low as 1.15\% errors and an average
                  processing speed that makes it a fast and quasi-real-time
                  alternative to shoulder surfing.},
